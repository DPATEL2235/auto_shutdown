Problem Statement: Here a company wants to implement the features to their infrastructure in which each and every EC2 instance can get  shutdown at given point of time per week. For an example some instances automatically shutdown after the office hours, some can get shutdown every weekends. So here I have implemented this scenario with the help of some AWS services.

AWS services which need to be used for the implementation:
    1) EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance
    2) IAM (Identitiy and Access Management) Service 
    3) Lambda Function
    4) Amazon EventBridge
